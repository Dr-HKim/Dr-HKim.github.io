# Pie Charts

Pie charts are not recommended in the R documentation, and their features are somewhat limited. The authors recommend bar or dot plots over pie charts because people are able to judge length more accurately than volume. Pie charts are created with the function pie(x, labels=) where x is a non-negative numeric vector indicating the area of each slice and labels= notes a character vector of names for the slices.

## Simple Pie Chart

```{r}
# Simple Pie Chart
slices <- c(10, 12,4, 16, 8)
lbls <- c("US", "UK", "Australia", "Germany", "France")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Pie Chart of Countries")
```

## Pie Chart with Annotated Percentages

```{r}
# Pie Chart with Percentages
slices <- c(10, 12, 4, 16, 8)
lbls <- c("US", "UK", "Australia", "Germany", "France")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
pie(slices,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
  	main="Pie Chart of Countries")
```

## 3D Pie Chart

The pie3D( ) function in the plotrix package provides 3D exploded pie charts.

```{r}
# 3D Exploded Pie Chart
library(plotrix)
slices <- c(10, 12, 4, 16, 8)
lbls <- c("US", "UK", "Australia", "Germany", "France")
pie3D(slices,labels=lbls,explode=0.1,
  	main="Pie Chart of Countries ")
```

## Creating Annotated Pies from a data frame

```{r}
# Pie Chart from data frame with Appended Sample Sizes
mytable <- table(iris$Species)
lbls <- paste(names(mytable), "\n", mytable, sep="")
pie(mytable, labels = lbls,
  	main="Pie Chart of Species\n (with sample sizes)")
```
