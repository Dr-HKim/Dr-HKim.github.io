***preface*** 이번 포스트에서는 데이터를 재구성하여 구조를 바꾸는 방법에 대하여 설명합니다.

# Reshaping Data

다음 자료를 참고하였습니다:  
- [http://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html](http://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html)

R provides a variety of methods for reshaping data prior to analysis.

## Transpose

Use the t() function to transpose a matrix or a data frame. In the later case, rownames become variable (column) names.

```r
# example using built-in dataset
 mtcars
 t(mtcars)
```

## The Reshape Package

Hadley Wickham has created a comprehensive package called reshape to massage data. Both an introduction and article are available. There is even a video!

Basically, you "melt" data so that each row is a unique id-variable combination. Then you "cast" the melted data into any shape you would like. Here is a very simple example.

mydata

id | time | x1 | x2
---|------|----|----
1  |1     |5   |6
1  |2     |3   |5
2  |1     |6   |1
2  |2     |2   |4

```r
# example of melt function
library(reshape)
mdata <- melt(mydata, id=c("id","time"))
```

newdata

id | time | variable | value
---|------|----------|-------
1  |1     |x1        |5
1  |2     |x1        |3
2  |1     |x1        |6
2  |2     |x1        |2
1  |1     |x2        |6
1  |2     |x2        |5
2  |1     |x2        |1
2  |2     |x2        |4

```r
# cast the melted data
# cast(data, formula, function)
subjmeans <- cast(mdata, id~variable, mean)
timemeans <- cast(mdata, time~variable, mean)
```

subjmeans

id | x1 | x2
---|----|----
1  |4   |5.5
2  |4   |2.5

timemeans

time | x1 | x2
-----|----|----
1    |5.5 |3.5
2    |2.5 |4.5

There is much more that you can do with the melt( ) and cast( ) functions. See the documentation for more details.
